# Project-violence-detect

A deep learning project to identify the violence from the videos (not real time).

# Abstract

We live in the society that relies heavily on the usage of the CCTV cameras for ensuring
high security. However, such an approach is highly controversial, as we usually
use CCTV footages, only hours or even days after the incident has occurred. These
CCTV footages are rarely used to prevent crime or react to it in real-time. The reason
for such an inefficiency is that the lack of human support for monitoring the huge
amount of CCTV footages. An efficient surveillance system can be developed with the
help of the technologies like computer vision, video-image processing and deep learning.
Meanwhile the action recognition community has been focused mostly only on
detecting simple actions like clapping, jogging, walking. The detection of aggressive
behaviours is still a barrier because of its complex nature. Many real time problems can
be solved by using machine learning and the data analytic techniques.
